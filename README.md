# APIProjects
This repository contains the Application Programming Interface Projects that I have done.

1. APIIncomePrediction: \
    In this project, I analyse the 'Adult Income Prediction' dataset from Kaggle and then build two machine learning models to classify the individuals with high or low incomes. I then build an API to do batch predictions using the best model.
